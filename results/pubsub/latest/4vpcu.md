    - gp3 25GB 8000 IOPS
    - Ubuntu 24.04

      - log tables are configured to vacuum analyze aggressively
    - goal: ~60% CPU
    - $0.118/h (1yr reserved) - $1033.68 a year
    - assume ~12h message retention (then to s3 or whatever); - deploy a 242GB disk (19.36/m at $0.08/GB-month)
        - 6000 * 0.005/provisioned IOPS-month = 30/m = $592.32/yr
