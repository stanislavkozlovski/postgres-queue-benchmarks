- server: c7i.xlarge (**the cheap version**)
    - gp3 25GB 8000 IOPS
    - Ubuntu 24.04
    - absolute default postgres settings
    - goal: ~60% CPU
    - $0.118/h (1yr reserved) - $1033.68 a year
    - assume ~12h message retention (then to s3 or whatever); - deploy a 242GB disk (19.36/m at $0.08/GB-month)
      - 6000 * 0.005/provisioned IOPS-month = 30/m = $592.32/yr
      - in reality, can offload to s3 by the hour
    - us-east-1a
- client: c7i.xlarge
    - 10 writers
    - 15 readers
    - 1 KB payload
    - 120s duration
    - us-east-1a

Notes:
- CPU bottlenecks due to number of readers/writers. With 50/50 read/write connections, it pegged to 100% CPU. At 100% CPU we could get ~4 MB/s out of the machine. And queue depth didn't seem to increase. But it was pegged at 100%.
- At this 4 vCPU size, we need less clients. 10 writes and 17 readers is a sweet spot. CPU at 60-68%.
- 3000k IOPS on gp3 was low too, had to increase it to 6000

# Run (limiting writes to max reads we can get)

Since writes massively outpace reads, we throttle writes to find the max 1:1 ratio the server can reach.
The bottleneck is the number of **reader clients**. If a client's p50 read latency is 5.4ms, then it can only read 185 messages a second.
The total read throughput is therefore bottlenecked by how many readers we can run in parallel without blowing up CPU.
As we said, we keep it at 60% CPU.
We limit ourselves to 15 readers at 2900 msg/s total.
