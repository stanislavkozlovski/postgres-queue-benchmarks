# Run 1 (unlimited writes)

```bash
./pg_queue_bench   --host=$HOST   --port=5432   --db=benchmark   --user=postgres   --password=postgres   --writers=50   --readers=50   --duration=120s   --payload=1024   --report=5s
```
Ran three times. See detailed results in [unlimited_writes_runs.md](./unlimited_writes_runs.md). It averages out to:

- ✍️ write: **12.2 MB/s**
- 📖️ read: **2.7 MB/s**
- write latency:
  - p99: 24 ms
  - p95: 10 ms
  - p50: 3.1 ms
- read latency:
  - p99: 73 ms
  - p95: 41 ms
  - p50: 15.5 ms
- bottleneck: 100% CPU

# Run 2 (limit writes to max reads we can get)

Since writes massively outpace reads, let's see if artificially throttling them to some rate can improve our reads.
Our goal is to figure out what's the max 1:1 ratio they can reach.
